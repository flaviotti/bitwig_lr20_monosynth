# bitwig_lr20_monosynth
Inspired by the legendary Korg MS20, this patch called LR20 feature a similar (albeit not identical) signal path. The VCOs are here implemented via two instances of the Xfer Serum plugin, but they can be replaced quite easily with other synths. The idea to use only Bitwig native solutions was strong, but I found that they were missing important characteristics for this patch.
Further patching and routing can be done by pluging modulators, although due to the bitwig UI limitations, it is not visually intuitive to follow the signal path.
